#### Using the Cloud SDK (gcloud)

1. **Install the Cloud SDK**: If you haven't already, install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. You can download it from the [official website](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

2. **Authenticate**: Run `gcloud auth login` to authenticate with your Google Cloud account.

3. **Create a Compute Engine Instance**:
   ```bash
   gcloud compute instances create INSTANCE_NAME \
       --machine-type MACHINE_TYPE \
       --image-family IMAGE_FAMILY \
       --image-project IMAGE_PROJECT \
       --zone ZONE
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your desired values.

4. **SSH Keys**:
   - To add SSH keys, use the `--metadata` flag:
     ```bash
     gcloud compute instances add-metadata INSTANCE_NAME \
         --metadata ssh-keys=USERNAME:SSH_KEY
     ```

   - Replace `USERNAME` with your desired username and `SSH_KEY` with your SSH public key.

5. **Additional Configuration**:
   - You can further customize the instance using additional flags such as `--tags`, `--metadata`, and more.

6. **Launch the Instance**: Run the following command to create the instance:
   ```bash
   gcloud compute instances create INSTANCE_NAME
   ```

#### Assigning Disks

When launching a Compute Engine instance, you can configure its disk options. This includes specifying the boot disk image, attaching additional disks, and configuring their size and type. Disk management can be done during instance creation or later by editing the instance configuration.

#### Setting Availability Policies

Compute Engine allows you to set availability policies to ensure high availability and redundancy. This can be achieved by distributing instances across multiple zones or regions. When creating an instance, you can select the region and zone where it will be deployed.

### 2. Creating an Autoscaled Managed Instance Group

Managed instance groups (MIGs) in Compute Engine provide the capability to automatically manage a group of identical virtual machine instances. They are ideal for distributing traffic and workloads across multiple instances, ensuring high availability and scalability.

To create an autoscaled managed instance group:

1. **Define an Instance Template**:
   - Create an instance template specifying the VM configuration, image, and other settings. You can do this using the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI.

2. **Create the Managed Instance Group**:
   - Using the Google Cloud Console, navigate to "Instance groups" and click "Create a group."
   - Select "Managed instance group" and configure it with your instance template, autoscaling settings, and load balancing if needed.
   - Using gcloud CLI:
     ```bash
     gcloud compute instance-groups managed create NAME \
         --base-instance-name BASE_INSTANCE_NAME \
         --size SIZE \
         --template TEMPLATE
     ```

3. **Autoscaling Configuration**:
   - Define autoscaling policies based on CPU utilization, custom metrics, or other factors to automatically adjust the number of instances in the group.

4. **Health Checks and Load Balancing**:
   - Configure health checks to determine the health of instances in the group.
   - Optionally, set up load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across the instances.

5. **Scaling**:
   - The group will automatically scale up or down based on the defined policies and health checks.

### 3. Generating/Uploading a Custom SSH Key

SSH keys are essential for secure access to Compute Engine instances. You can either generate SSH keys or upload existing ones.

#### Generating SSH Keys

1. **Generate SSH Key Pair**:
   - Use the `ssh-keygen` command to generate an SSH key pair:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/my-ssh-key
     ```

2. **Copy the Public Key**:
   - Use `cat` or your preferred text editor to view and copy the contents of the public key (`~/.ssh/my-ssh-key.pub`).

3. **Add the Public Key to Compute Engine**:
   - When creating an instance through the Google Cloud Console or gcloud CLI, you can add the public key to the instance's metadata.

#### Uploading an Existing SSH Key

If you already have an SSH key pair that you want to use for Compute Engine instances:

1. **Upload the Public Key to Compute Engine**:
   - Use the Google Cloud Console to upload your SSH public key to the project's metadata.

2. **Use the Key in Instance Creation**:
   - When creating an instance, select the uploaded SSH key from the project's metadata.

### 4. Installing and Configuring the Cloud Monitoring and Logging Agent

Monitoring and logging are crucial for managing your Compute Engine resources effectively. Google Cloud offers the Cloud Monitoring and Logging Agent to collect and send logs and metrics to Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging.

To install and configure the agent:

1. **SSH into the Compute Engine Instance**:
   -

 Use SSH to connect to your Compute Engine instance.

2. **Install the Monitoring and Logging Agent**:
   - Run the following commands to install the agent on a Linux-based instance:
