# Section 3: Deploying and Implementing a Cloud Solution

## 3.1 Deploying and Implementing Compute Engine Resources

### Launching a Compute Instance
- When launching a Compute Engine instance, you can customize it by:
  - **Machine Type**: Specify the virtual CPU (vCPU) and memory configurations. Custom machine types can also be created.
  - **Disks**: Configure boot disks with the operating system and additional data disks. You can select from various disk types (Standard, SSD, etc.).
  - **Metadata**: Add metadata to instances to pass key-value pairs for custom configuration.
  - **Availability Policies**: Configure high availability by selecting multiple zones for your instances.
  - **SSH Keys**: Add SSH keys for secure access to instances. You can specify keys during creation or later via metadata.
- For advanced customization, you can use [instance templates](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-templates) for consistent instance configurations.

### Creating an Autoscaled Managed Instance Group
- Managed instance groups (MIGs) are used to ensure high availability and scalability.
- Components of a MIG include:
  - **Instance Template**: Specifies the configuration for instances in the group.
  - **Autoscaler**: Defines rules for scaling based on metrics like CPU utilization.
  - **Health Check**: Monitors the health of instances and determines when to replace unhealthy ones.
- MIGs automatically distribute instances across zones, and you can configure rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments.

### Generating/Uploading a Custom SSH Key
- To generate an SSH key pair locally, use the `ssh-keygen` command:
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/my-ssh-key
  ```
- To upload a public SSH key to a Compute Engine instance during creation, you can use the `--metadata` flag with the `ssh-keys` key:
  ```bash
  gcloud compute instances create my-instance --metadata ssh-keys=USERNAME:PUBLIC_KEY
  ```
- Replace `USERNAME` with your username and `PUBLIC_KEY` with the actual public key content.

### Installing and Configuring the Cloud Monitoring and Logging Agent
- The Cloud Monitoring and Logging Agent (formerly known as the Google Cloud Operations Agent) collects system and application logs and metrics from Compute Engine instances.
- To install the agent:
  - For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ops-agent
    ```
  - For RHEL/CentOS-based systems:
    ```bash
    sudo yum install ops-agent
    ```
- Configuration is done through the `/etc/google-cloud-ops-agent/config.yaml` file, where you specify which logs and metrics to collect.

### Assessing Compute Quotas and Requesting Increases
- Quotas can limit the number of resources you can create. To assess quotas:
  - Navigate to the [Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas) in the Cloud Console.
  - Select your project and filter for the specific resource type you're interested in.
- To request quota increases:
  - Click "Edit Quotas" and follow the prompts to submit a request.
  - Explain your use case and provide justification for the increase.

## 3.2 Deploying and Implementing Google Kubernetes Engine Resources

### Installing and Configuring kubectl
- `kubectl` is used to interact with Kubernetes clusters. To install it:
  - On Linux:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
    ```
  - On macOS (with Homebrew):
    ```bash
    brew install kubectl
    ```
  - For other platforms, download the binary from the [official Kubernetes release page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).
