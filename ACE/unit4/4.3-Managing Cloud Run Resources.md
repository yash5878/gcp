# Managing Cloud Run Resources

## Introduction
Cloud Run is a managed compute platform provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that allows you to run containerized applications in a fully managed environment. This technical note covers various aspects of managing Cloud Run resources, from adjusting application traffic-splitting parameters to making decisions between Cloud Run (fully managed) and Cloud Run for Anthos.

## Basics
### Adjusting Application Traffic-Splitting Parameters
Traffic splitting in Cloud Run allows you to gradually migrate traffic from one version of your application to another. You can use the `gcloud` CLI to set traffic percentages for different service versions. For example, to route 80% of traffic to version `v2`:
```bash
gcloud run services update [SERVICE_NAME] --split [SERVICE_VERSION]=80
```

### Setting Scaling Parameters for Autoscaling Instances
Cloud Run provides automatic scaling based on incoming requests. You can configure scaling parameters, such as the maximum number of instances, using the `gcloud` CLI or the Cloud Console. To set the maximum number of instances to 10 for a service:
```bash
gcloud run services update [SERVICE_NAME] --max-instances 10
```

### Determining Whether to Use Cloud Run (Fully Managed) or Cloud Run for Anthos
The choice between Cloud Run (fully managed) and Cloud Run for Anthos depends on your specific use case.

#### Cloud Run (Fully Managed)
- Ideal for running containerized applications in a serverless, fully managed environment.
- Well-suited for stateless, ephemeral workloads that don't require advanced Kubernetes features.
- Offers automatic scaling, simple deployment, and pay-per-use pricing.

#### Cloud Run for Anthos
- Suitable for workloads that require advanced Kubernetes features and control.
- Allows running containers in your GKE clusters, enabling more customization and integration with Kubernetes.
- Best for applications with complex networking requirements, existing Kubernetes expertise, or a need to run alongside existing GKE workloads.

## Use Cases
- Cloud Run (Fully Managed) is a great choice for web applications, APIs, and microservices that need to scale quickly in response to incoming traffic without managing infrastructure.

- Cloud Run for Anthos is suitable when you need more control, require stateful workloads, or have applications that can benefit from running within your GKE clusters.

## Advantages
### Cloud Run (Fully Managed)
- Serverless: No need to manage the underlying infrastructure.
- Automatic scaling: Scales up or down based on incoming requests.
- Cost-effective: Pay only for the resources used.

### Cloud Run for Anthos
- Kubernetes integration: Run in your GKE clusters with advanced Kubernetes features.
- Customization: Full control over your environment.
- Portability: Run anywhere Kubernetes is supported.

In summary, managing Cloud Run resources involves configuring traffic-splitting parameters, scaling parameters, and making informed decisions about whether to use Cloud Run (fully managed) or Cloud Run for Anthos based on your specific requirements.
