# Technical Notes on Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging

## Introduction

Monitoring and logging are crucial components of any cloud-based system, as they provide visibility into the health, performance, and security of your infrastructure and applications. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers a comprehensive set of tools and services for monitoring and logging, enabling you to gain insights into your resources and applications. In this document, we will explore various aspects of GCP's monitoring and logging capabilities, including creating alerts, ingesting custom metrics, configuring log sinks, log routers, viewing logs, using diagnostics, and checking Google Cloud status.

## Use Cases

Before delving into the technical details, let's understand the common use cases for Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging:

1. **Infrastructure Health Monitoring**: Ensure that your virtual machines, databases, and other GCP resources are running smoothly. Create alerts for CPU usage, memory consumption, and other resource metrics.

2. **Application Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the performance of your applications, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues using custom metrics and logs.

3. **Security and Compliance**: Keep an eye on security events by monitoring authentication logs, firewall rules, and any other events that could indicate a security breach or non-compliance with security policies.

4. **Troubleshooting and Debugging**: Use logs and diagnostics to investigate application issues, pinpoint the root cause, and reduce downtime.

5. **Resource Optimization**: Understand resource utilization trends and make informed decisions about resource scaling and optimization.

Now, let's explore the advantages of using Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging.

## Advantages

Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging offer several key advantages:
