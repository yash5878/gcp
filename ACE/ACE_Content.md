## 5.1 Managing Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### Viewing IAM Policies
- You can view IAM policies for Google Cloud resources through the Google Cloud Console, `gcloud` command-line tool, or the IAM API. Detailed information can be found in the [Viewing and understanding IAM policies](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles) documentation.

### Creating IAM Policies
- Create IAM policies to define who (identity) has what access (role) on which resources. You can create and edit policies using the Google Cloud Console or programmatically through APIs. Learn how to create and manage policies in the [Creating and managing policies](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/policies) documentation.

### Managing the Various Role Types and Defining Custom IAM Roles
- Google Cloud IAM offers three types of roles:
   - **Primitive Roles:** These are predefined roles with broad permissions like Owner, Editor, and Viewer.
   - **Predefined Roles:** Curated sets of permissions for specific Google Cloud services.
   - **Custom Roles:** You can define fine-grained permissions with custom roles tailored to your needs. 
   Explore the [Understanding roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles) documentation for comprehensive information on role types and creating custom roles.

## 5.2 Managing Service Accounts

### Creating Service Accounts
- Service accounts are created through the Google Cloud Console, `gcloud` command-line tool, or programmatically using the IAM API. Refer to the [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) documentation for step-by-step instructions.

### Using Service Accounts in IAM Policies with Minimum Permissions
- Best practices include granting service accounts only the permissions they need to perform their tasks, following the principle of least privilege. Learn how to configure IAM policies for service accounts in the [Granting roles to service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-to-service-accounts) documentation.

### Assigning Service Accounts to Resources
- Assign service accounts to resources such as virtual machines, Google Kubernetes Engine clusters, and Cloud Functions. The process varies by resource type; refer to resource-specific documentation for details.

### Managing IAM of a Service Account
- You can manage the IAM policies associated with a service account to control who can impersonate or use the service account. Refer to the [Managing service account IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-service-account-iam) documentation for detailed instructions.

### Managing Service Account Impersonation
- Service account impersonation allows one service account to act as another, often used for secure delegation of permissions. Review the [Service account impersonation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/impersonating-service-accounts) documentation for guidance on configuring and using this feature.

### Creating and Managing Short-Lived Service Account Credentials
- Short-lived service account credentials (access tokens) can be generated for secure, temporary access. Learn about creating and managing these credentials in the [Creating short-lived service account credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-short-lived-service-account-credentials) documentation.
