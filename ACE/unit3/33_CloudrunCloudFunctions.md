## 1. Introduction to Cloud Run and Cloud Functions

### Overview of Serverless Computing

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where you don't need to provision or manage servers. Instead, you focus on writing code, and the cloud provider manages the infrastructure, automatically scaling your application as needed. This model is cost-effective, as you only pay for the resources you use. Google Cloud offers two serverless compute services: Cloud Run and Cloud Functions.

### Cloud Run vs. Cloud Functions

**Cloud Run**:
- Cloud Run allows you to run containerized applications in a fully managed environment.
- You package your application code and dependencies into a Docker container, which can be easily deployed on Cloud Run.
- It supports HTTP requests and can serve web applications.
- You can specify the number of concurrent requests (concurrency) and memory allocated to your container.
- It's ideal for applications that require a more traditional server environment.

**Cloud Functions**:
- Cloud Functions is designed for running single, event-triggered functions in response to various cloud events.
- Functions are written in languages like Node.js, Python, Go, and more.
- It's event-driven, meaning it reacts to events like HTTP requests, Pub/Sub messages, and Cloud Storage changes.
- You don't manage servers, and it scales automatically with the number of incoming events.
- It's best suited for microservices and event-driven architectures.
