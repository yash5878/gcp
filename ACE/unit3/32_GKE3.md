## 2. Prerequisites

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account Setup

Before you begin, you need a GCP account. Follow the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/getting-started) to set up your account and create a new project.

### GCP CLI Installation

Install the Google Cloud SDK, which includes the `gcloud` CLI for interacting with GCP services. You can find installation instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install).

### Docker Installation

Ensure Docker is installed on your local machine. You can download it from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## 3. Installing and Configuring kubectl

### Installing kubectl

Kubectl is the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. Install it using the following commands:

```shell
# Linux
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

# macOS
brew install kubectl

# Windows
# Download the Windows executable from the Kubernetes release page and add it to your PATH.
```

### Authenticating kubectl with GCP

After installing kubectl, authenticate it with your GCP account by running:

```shell
gcloud auth login
```

## 4. Deploying a GKE Cluster

### Creating a GKE Cluster

You can create a GKE cluster using the `gcloud` CLI or through the GCP Console. Here's a CLI example:

```shell
gcloud container clusters create my-cluster --num-nodes=3 --zone=us-central1-a
```

This command creates a cluster named "my-cluster" with three nodes in the "us-central1-a" zone. You can customize the cluster configuration based on your requirements.

### Cluster Configuration Options

#### Autopilot Clusters

Autopilot mode simplifies cluster management by automatically provisioning and managing resources, including nodes. To create an Autopilot cluster:

```shell
gcloud container clusters create my-autopilot-cluster --autopilot
```

#### Regional Clusters

Regional clusters provide high availability by spanning multiple zones within a region:

```shell
gcloud container clusters create my-regional-cluster --num-nodes=3 --region=us-central1
```

#### Private Clusters

Private clusters don't have external IPs for nodes, enhancing security:

```shell
gcloud container clusters create my-private-cluster --num-nodes=3 --private-cluster
```

### Customizing Node Pools

You can add custom node pools to your cluster with specific machine types and configurations:

```shell
gcloud container node-pools create my-pool --cluster=my-cluster --num-nodes=2 --machine-type=n1-standard-2
```

## 5. Deploying a Containerized Application to GKE
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/stateless-apps
### Preparing Your Application for Kubernetes

Before deploying your application to GKE, ensure it is containerized using Docker. Create a Dockerfile to define the container image.
## 6. Get the credentials of GKE
```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster \
    --location us-central1-a
```
### Creating Kubernetes Deployment Manifests

Kubernetes uses YAML manifests to define resources such as pods, services, and deployments. Create a Deployment manifest (e.g., `my-app-deployment.yaml`) for your application:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-app
        image: us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:1.0
```

### Deploying Your Application



Apply the deployment manifest to deploy your application:

```shell
kubectl apply -f my-app-deployment.yaml
```

This creates pods running your application based on the specified image.

### Managing Deployments

You can manage deployments using kubectl commands:

- `kubectl get deployments` - List deployments.
- `kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=5` - Scale the number of replicas.
- `kubectl rollout status deployment/my-app` - Check rollout status.

### Autoscaling Applications

Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) to automatically adjust the number of replicas based on resource utilization:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 50
```

Apply the HPA manifest:

```shell
kubectl apply -f my-app-hpa.yaml
```

## 6. Configuring GKE Monitoring and Logging

### Enabling Stackdriver Monitoring

Stackdriver Monitoring provides real-time visibility into the performance and health of your GKE cluster. Enable it for your cluster:

```shell
gcloud container clusters update my-cluster --monitoring-service=monitoring.googleapis.com
```

### Configuring Stackdriver Logging

Stackdriver Logging allows you to collect, view, and analyze logs from your GKE cluster. Enable it:

```shell
gcloud container clusters update my-cluster --logging-service=logging.googleapis.com
```

### Creating Custom Metrics and Alerts

You can create custom metrics and alerts using Stackdriver:

- Define custom metrics to track specific application or cluster metrics.
- Set up alerts based on custom or predefined metrics to receive notifications for critical events.

### Integration with Prometheus

GKE integrates seamlessly with Prometheus for advanced monitoring and alerting. Configure Prometheus and Grafana for custom monitoring dashboards.

## 7. Scaling and Managing GKE Clusters

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

HPA automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas based on resource utilization metrics. Configure HPA for your application as shown earlier.

### Cluster Autoscaler

The Cluster Autoscaler monitors node resource utilization and automatically adjusts the size of the node pool to meet workload demands. No manual intervention is required.

### Node Pool Management

You can create additional node pools in your cluster with different machine types or labels:

```shell
gcloud container node-pools create my-pool --cluster=my-cluster --num-nodes=2 --machine-type=n1-standard-4
```

### Upgrading Cluster Versions

Regularly update your GKE cluster to the latest Kubernetes version to benefit from security updates and new features:

```shell
gcloud container clusters upgrade my-cluster --master --cluster-version=1.21
```

## 8. Securing Your GKE Cluster

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC allows you to define granular permissions for users and service accounts within the cluster. Create custom roles and role bindings to restrict access to sensitive resources.

### Network Policies

Network policies define how pods communicate with each other. Implement network policies to control traffic between pods and enhance security.

### Private Clusters and VPC Peering

Private clusters don't have external IP addresses for nodes, making them more secure. You can also set up VPC peering to isolate GKE clusters in private networks.

## 9. High Availability and Disaster Recovery

### Regional Clusters for HA

Regional clusters span multiple zones, ensuring high availability. In case of a zone failure, your application remains accessible.

### Backup and Restore Strategies

Implement backup and restore strategies for critical data. Consider using tools like Velero or Cloud Storage for backups.

### Disaster Recovery Planning

Plan for disaster recovery scenarios, including data loss, and have procedures in place for swift recovery.

## 10. Advanced GKE Features

### Istio Service Mesh Integration
