Resource hierarchy

The purpose of the Google Cloud resource hierarchy is two-fold:

1. Provide a hierarchy of ownership, which binds the lifecycle of a resource to its immediate parent in the hierarchy.
2. Provide attach points and inheritance for access control and organization policies.

Resource hierarchy is similar to the file system found in traditional OS as a way of organizing and managing entities hierarchyically.
