# Section 1: Bootstrapping a Google Cloud Organization for DevOps

## 1.1 Designing the Overall Resource Hierarchy for an Organization

### Projects and Folders

- **Projects**: Organize resources into Google Cloud projects. Projects provide isolation and billing boundaries. Consider using a project for each major application or environment. [Google Cloud Projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)

- **Folders**: Use folders to create a hierarchical structure for projects. Folders can represent teams, departments, or applications. Folders help organize resources and apply policies consistently. [Google Cloud Folders](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders)

### Shared Networking

- **VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds)**: Create isolated network environments using VPCs. Shared VPCs enable you to connect multiple projects to a common network while maintaining isolation. [Google Cloud VPC](https://cloud.google.com/vpc)

- **Firewall Rules**: Define firewall rules to control traffic between projects. Use tags and service accounts to specify firewall rules for resources. [Google Cloud Firewall Rules](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls)

- **Peering and VPN**: Establish network connections between projects or on-premises data centers using VPC peering or VPN tunnels. [VPC Peering](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering) [Cloud VPN](https://cloud.google.com/vpn/docs)

### Identity and Access Management (IAM) Roles and Organization-Level Policies

- **IAM Roles**: Define custom IAM roles to grant precise permissions to users and service accounts. Create roles that follow the principle of least privilege. [Google Cloud IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs)

- **Organization Policies**: Enforce security and compliance using organization-level policies. Implement policies that control resource creation and configuration. [Google Cloud Org Policies](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/defining-organization-policy-constraints)

### Creating and Managing Service Accounts

- **Service Account Principles**: Create service accounts for DevOps processes and applications. Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions. [Google Cloud Service Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)

- **Secrets Management**: Safeguard service account keys and credentials using Google Secret Manager. Store and manage sensitive data securely. [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs)

## 1.2 Managing Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Infrastructure as Code Tooling

- **Google Cloud Deployment Manager**: Use Deployment Manager to define and manage Google Cloud resources using templates written in Python or Jinja2. [Google Cloud Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs)

- **Terraform**: Terraform is a widely adopted IaC tool that supports Google Cloud. Use Terraform configurations to manage infrastructure as code. [Terraform on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-on-gcp-with-terraform)

- **Helm**: Helm is ideal for Kubernetes-based deployments. Package and deploy Kubernetes applications using Helm charts. [Helm on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-helm)

### Making Infrastructure Changes Using Google-Recommended Practices and IaC Blueprints

- **Best Practices**: Follow Google's best practices for IaC, such as modular templates, parameterization, and version control. [Google Cloud IaC Best Practices](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/introducing-deployment-manager-best-practices)

- **Deployment Manager Blueprints**: Explore Google's Deployment Manager Blueprints for pre-configured templates following recommended practices. [Deployment Manager Blueprints](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/blueprints)

### Immutable Architecture

- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Implement an immutable infrastructure approach by creating new components when changes are needed instead of modifying existing ones. Use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to support immutable deployments. [Immutable Infrastructure on GKE](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/immutable-infrastructure-on-gke)

## 1.3 Designing a CI/CD Architecture Stack in Google Cloud

### CI with Cloud Build

- **Google Cloud Build**: Google Cloud Build is a fully managed CI/CD platform that automates the build, test, and deployment process. It integrates seamlessly with popular version control systems such as Git. [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build)

- **Build Triggers**: Set up build triggers in Cloud Build to automatically initiate builds when code changes are pushed to your source code repository. You can use conditions and filters to control when builds are triggered. [Cloud Build Triggers](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/running-builds/automate-builds)

### CD with Google Cloud Deploy

- **Google Cloud Deploy**: Google Cloud Deploy provides continuous delivery capabilities. It allows you to define deployment pipelines that automate the process of promoting code changes through different environments, from development to production. [Google Cloud Deploy](https://cloud.google.com/deploy)

- **Deployment Configurations**: Create deployment configurations in Google Cloud Deploy to define how your applications are deployed. These configurations specify the target environments, rollout strategies, and more. [Deployment Configurations](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/concepts/deployment-configuration)

- **Rollback Strategies**: Implement rollback strategies in your CD pipeline to handle failed deployments gracefully. Google Cloud Deploy allows you to roll back to a previous known-good state when issues arise during deployment.

### Widely Used Third-Party Tooling

- **Jenkins**: If your organization uses Jenkins for CI/CD, you can integrate it with Google Cloud services using plugins and extensions. [Jenkins on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/jenkins-on-compute-engine)

- **Git**: Git is a fundamental tool for version control. Integrate Git with your CI/CD pipelines to manage source code effectively. Google Cloud offers Git repositories as part of its source code management tools.

- **ArgoCD**: For Kubernetes-based deployments, ArgoCD is a popular choice. It enables GitOps workflows, where your cluster configurations are stored in a Git repository, and ArgoCD ensures that the cluster matches the desired state defined in Git. [ArgoCD on Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/deploying-argo-cd-on-gke)

- **Packer**: Use Packer to create machine images and containers that are pre-configured with your applications and dependencies. These images can be used for consistent and efficient deployments. [Packer on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/managing-infrastructure-as-code-using-packer)

### Security of CI/CD Tooling

- **IAM Permissions**: Apply the principle of least privilege to the service accounts used by your CI/CD tools. Grant only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Use Google Cloud's IAM capabilities to manage access control. [Google Cloud IAM Best Practices](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/using-iam-securely)

- **Secret Management**: Safeguard CI/CD secrets and credentials using Google Secret Manager or a secure secret management solution. Never store sensitive information in code repositories. [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs)

- **Security Scanning**: Implement automated security scanning tools in your CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities in both your application code and dependencies. Google Cloud Security Scanner can help you find common web application vulnerabilities. [Google Cloud Security Scanner](https://cloud.google.com/security-scanner)

## 1.4 Managing Multiple Environments

### Determining the Number of Environments and Their Purpose

- **Environment Types**: Define different environments, such as staging, production, testing, and development, based on your organization's needs. Each environment serves a specific purpose in the software development lifecycle.

### Creating Environments Dynamically with GKE and Terraform

- **Feature Branch Environments**: Implement dynamic environment creation for feature branches using tools like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Terraform. This approach allows isolated testing and development for new features. [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)

- **Infrastructure Automation**: Use infrastructure automation scripts and Terraform to provision and de-provision feature branch environments as needed. Infrastructure as Code allows you to define and manage the infrastructure for each environment consistently.

### Anthos Config Management

- **Anthos Config Management**: For organizations managing Kubernetes environments, Anthos Config Management provides a powerful solution for policy-driven configuration management and GitOps-style management of Kubernetes configurations across multiple clusters and environments.
