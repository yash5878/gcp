Let's use your specified project ID, dataset, and location for the example using the `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality` dataset. In this case, we'll predict the birth weight of babies based on various features.

### Step 1: Setup
Make sure you are working within the specified project, dataset, and location.

```sql
-- Set the project, dataset, and location
SET project_id = 'praxis-atrium-402218';
SET dataset_id = 'new_ds';
SET location = 'US';
```

### Step 2: Explore the Dataset
```sql
-- Examine the structure of the natality dataset
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality`
LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 3: Preprocess Data
```sql
-- Clean the dataset and select relevant features
-- For simplicity, let's use mother's age, plurality, and gestation weeks as features
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.processed_data` AS
SELECT
  weight_pounds,
  mother_age,
  plurality,
  gestation_weeks
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality`
WHERE
  weight_pounds IS NOT NULL
  AND mother_age IS NOT NULL
  AND plurality IS NOT NULL
  AND gestation_weeks IS NOT NULL;
```

### Step 4: Train the Model (Corrected)
```sql
-- Create a linear regression model
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.natality_model`
OPTIONS(model_type='linear_reg', input_label_cols=['weight_pounds']) AS
SELECT
  mother_age,
  plurality,
  gestation_weeks,
  weight_pounds
FROM
  `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.processed_data`;
```
This query explicitly specifies `weight_pounds` as the label column in the `OPTIONS` clause. Please use this corrected query for Step 4, and it should resolve the error.

### Step 5: Evaluate the Model
```sql
-- Evaluate the model's performance
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.natality_model`,
    (
    SELECT
      mother_age,
      plurality,
      gestation_weeks,
      weight_pounds
    FROM
      `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.processed_data`
    )
  );
```

### Step 6: Make Predictions
```sql
-- Apply the trained model to make predictions
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.PREDICT(MODEL `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.natality_model`,
    (
    SELECT
      mother_age,
      plurality,
      gestation_weeks
    FROM
      `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.processed_data`
    )
  );
```

Remember to replace 'praxis-atrium-402218' and 'new_ds' with your actual project ID and dataset name if they differ. These queries should work for your specified project, dataset, and location.
