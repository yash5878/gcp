Let's use the `bigquery-public-data.samples.ncaa_basketball` dataset to predict the number of points a college basketball team will score based on various features. We'll go through each step in detail.

### Step 1: Setup
```sql
-- Set the project, dataset, and location
SET project_id = 'praxis-atrium-402218';
SET dataset_id = 'new_ds';
SET location = 'US';
```

### Step 2: Explore the Dataset
```sql
-- Examine the structure of the NCAA basketball dataset
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.ncaa_basketball`
LIMIT 10;
```

**Explanation:** In this step, we're looking at the structure of the dataset to understand its columns and values.

### Step 3: Preprocess Data
```sql
-- Clean the dataset and select relevant features
-- For simplicity, let's use the number of field goals made, free throws made, and the total points as features
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.ncaa_processed` AS
SELECT
  field_goals_made,
  free_throws_made,
  total_points
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.samples.ncaa_basketball`
WHERE
  field_goals_made IS NOT NULL
  AND free_throws_made IS NOT NULL
  AND total_points IS NOT NULL;
```

**Explanation:** We're cleaning the dataset by selecting relevant features and creating a new table with these features.

### Step 4: Train the Model
```sql
-- Create a linear regression model
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.ncaa_model`
OPTIONS(model_type='linear_reg', input_label_cols=['total_points']) AS
SELECT
  field_goals_made,
  free_throws_made,
  total_points
FROM
  `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.ncaa_processed`;
```

**Explanation:** We're creating a linear regression model to predict `total_points` using `field_goals_made` and `free_throws_made` as features.

### Step 5: Evaluate the Model
```sql
-- Evaluate the model's performance
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.ncaa_model`,
    (
    SELECT
      field_goals_made,
      free_throws_made,
      total_points
    FROM
      `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.ncaa_processed`
    )
  );
```

**Explanation:** We're evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, etc.

### Step 6: Make Predictions
```sql
-- Apply the trained model to make predictions
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.PREDICT(MODEL `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.ncaa_model`,
    (
    SELECT
      field_goals_made,
      free_throws_made
    FROM
      `praxis-atrium-402218.new_ds.ncaa_processed`
    )
  );
```

**Explanation:** We're using the trained model to make predictions on new data.

### Conclusion:
- Recap the steps performed in the lab.
- Emphasize the importance of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### Additional Notes:
- Participants can experiment with different features and model types.
- Encourage exploring other public datasets for more complex scenarios.
- Remind participants to clean up resources to avoid unnecessary charges.

Remember to replace 'praxis-atrium-402218' and 'new_ds' with your actual project ID and dataset name if they differ. Adjust the features and labels accordingly based on the structure of the dataset you are working with.
