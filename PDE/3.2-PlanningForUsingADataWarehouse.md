## 1. Understanding Data Warehousing

Before delving into the planning considerations, it's crucial to have a clear understanding of what a data warehouse is and its role in the data ecosystem.

### What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores large volumes of structured data from various sources. It is designed for efficient querying, reporting, and data analysis. Key characteristics of a data warehouse include:

- **Centralization:** Data from multiple sources is integrated into a single repository.
- **Structured Data:** Data is organized into tables and columns.
- **Historical Data:** Data warehouses typically store historical data to support trend analysis.
- **Performance Optimization:** Data is indexed and optimized for query performance.

### Why Use a Data Warehouse?

Organizations use data warehouses for several reasons:

- **Data Analysis:** It provides a platform for in-depth analysis, reporting, and business intelligence.
- **Historical Trend Analysis:** Historical data allows organizations to analyze trends and make data-driven decisions.
- **Data Consistency:** Centralized data ensures data consistency and accuracy.
- **Scalability:** Data warehouses can scale to handle large volumes of data.
- **Security:** They provide robust security features to protect sensitive data.

## 2. Designing the Data Model

A well-designed data model is the foundation of an effective data warehouse. It defines how data is structured, organized, and related within the warehouse.

### Key Considerations

- **Dimensional Modeling:** This technique involves organizing data into fact tables (containing measures) and dimension tables (containing attributes). It simplifies querying for analytical purposes.

- **Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema:** Decide whether to use a star schema (simpler, but denormalized) or a snowflake schema (normalized, but more complex).

- **ETL Processes:** Plan Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to populate the data warehouse.

### Hands-On Lab 1: Designing the Data Model

#### GUI Exercise

Use Google BigQuery's Data Modeling capabilities to design a simple data model. Create a dataset, define tables, and establish relationships. [Link to BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)

#### CLI Exercise

Use Google Cloud CLI to create a BigQuery dataset, define tables, and load data into them. 

```bash
# Create a BigQuery dataset
bq --location=US mk --dataset my-dataset

# Create tables and schema
bq mk --table my-dataset.my-table my-schema.json

# Load data into the table
bq load --autodetect my-dataset.my-table gs://my-bucket/my-data.csv
```

## 3. Degree of Data Normalization

Data normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. In the context of a data warehouse, the degree of data normalization impacts query performance and storage efficiency.

### Considerations

- **Normalization Levels:** Decide on the level of normalization. Higher normalization reduces redundancy but may increase query complexity.
- **Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema:** The choice of schema design also affects data normalization.

### Hands-On Lab 2: Data Normalization

#### GUI Exercise

Use Google BigQuery to create a normalized and a denormalized version of a dataset, and compare their query performance. [Link to BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)

#### CLI Exercise

Use SQL commands to normalize and denormalize a dataset in Google BigQuery.

```sql
-- Normalized version
CREATE TABLE normalized_table AS
SELECT
  customer_id,
  customer_name,
  order_id,
  order_date
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;

-- Denormalized version
CREATE TABLE denormalized_table AS
SELECT
  customer_id,
  customer_name,
  ARRAY_AGG(order_id) AS order_ids,
  ARRAY_AGG(order_date) AS order_dates
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
GROUP BY customer_id, customer_name;
```

## 4. Mapping Business Requirements

Understanding and mapping business requirements is crucial for designing a data warehouse that meets the organization's needs.

### Steps:

- **Business Stakeholder Interviews:** Conduct interviews to gather requirements from business stakeholders.
- **Data Requirements:** Identify the data needed for analysis and reporting.
- **Reporting and Analysis:** Determine the types of reports and analyses required.
- **Performance Requirements:** Define query performance expectations.

### Hands-On Lab 3: Mapping Business Requirements

#### GUI Exercise

Create a project plan in Google Sheets that outlines the business requirements, data sources, and reporting needs for a fictitious company. [Link to Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/)

#### CLI Exercise

Use Google Cloud CLI to create a project plan in Google Sheets.

```bash
# Create a new Google Sheets document
gcloud sheets create my-project-plan --title "Data Warehouse Project Plan"

# Add data to the sheet
gcloud sheets values append --spreadsheet "my-project-plan" --range "A1" --value-input-option "RAW" --values "Requirement, Data Source, Reporting Needs"
gcloud sheets values append --spreadsheet "my-project-plan" --range "A2" --value-input-option "RAW" --values "Sales Analysis, Sales Database, Monthly sales report"
```

## 5. Defining Architecture to Support Data Access Patterns

The architecture of your data warehouse should align with data access patterns. Consider how users will interact with the data and design the architecture accordingly.

### Considerations

- **Query Patterns:** Identify common query patterns (e.g., ad-hoc queries, complex aggregations).
- **Concurrency:** Plan for the number of concurrent users and queries.
- **Data Distribution:** Consider how data will be distributed across nodes or clusters for scalability.
- **Data Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data.

### Hands-On Lab 4: Defining Data Access Architecture

#### GUI Exercise

Use Google Cloud's architecture design tools to create an architectural diagram

 that illustrates the components of your data warehouse and how they support data access patterns. [Link to Google Cloud Architecture Diagram Tool](https://cloud.google.com/architecture-center/cloud-diagram-editor/start-drawing)

#### CLI Exercise

Use Google Cloud CLI to create a network diagram that represents the data access architecture.

```bash
# Create a diagram using Google Cloud Drawings API
gcloud alpha drawings operations create --async my-diagram --object-type "drawing" --version "1.0"
```
