### 1.3 Designing the Migration Validation Strategy

**Use Case: Ensuring Data Integrity with BigQuery Data Transfer**

**Validation Strategy:**

1. **Sample queries:**
   - Develop a suite of sample queries that cover different aspects of the data and validate the results.
   - **Lab:**
     - **Step 1:** Use [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) to create sample queries.
     - **Step 2

:** Execute queries and validate results.

2. **Data profiling:**
   - Utilize Google Cloud Profiler to analyze data distributions and identify anomalies.
   - **Lab:**
     - **Step 1:** Access [Cloud Profiler](https://cloud.google.com/profiler) and configure for data profiling.
     - **Step 2:** Analyze profiling results.

3. **Incremental validation:**
   - Establish a validation schedule, performing incremental validations at regular intervals using automated scripts.
