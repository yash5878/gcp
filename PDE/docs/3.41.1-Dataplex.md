Automated Data Profiling and Quality Scan Features in Dataplex: Understanding the Difference and Key Features

Automated data profiling and quality scan for better understanding and evaluation of data
- Data profiling analyzes and summarizes the characteristics of the dataset for better decision-making
- Data quality scan examines data to assess overall quality, including accuracy, completeness, and compliance

Automated data profiling provides important metrics for understanding data quality.
- Auto profiling generates metrics for each column in a BigQuery table.
- Metrics include data type, uniqueness, and percentage of null values.

Data profiling provides insights on data anomalies and changes in ID systems.
- Profiling metrics can help identify data issues such as outliers and changes in ID systems.
- Quality scans evaluate data columns based on specified rules and dimensions like completeness and uniqueness.

Data quality checks provide useful information on failed records and their queries.
- Failed records can be easily identified and their specific failed rules can be viewed.
- Queries to retrieve failed records can be directly executed in BigQuery.

Automated data profiling and quality scan is a good starting point with useful results.
- UI can provide rules for profiling and save time on setting data quality rules from scratch.
- Exporting information from the UI is not easy, but using a YAML format can define rules and expectations for each column, which can be loaded via the gcloud CLI.

Automated data profiling and quality scan via Dataplex
- A small Python script that allows you to specify a project, location, and data scan ID
- Unpacks and extracts information from different types of expectations, such as SQL and regex
- Generates a YAML file that can be used to create data quality checks in BigQuery or Data Lake

Automated data profiling and quality scan via Dataplex
- Data ingestion pipeline with incremental loading and validation
- Using YAML for easy management and compatibility with different tools
- Considerations for excluding sensitive data from profiling results

Dataplex enables easy data profiling and quality scans
- Data profiling helps identify potential data quality issues
- Integration with data governance vendors enhances data management capabilities

Documentation improvement needed for finding things in Python SDK.
- Yaml-based rule description for data quality checks should be utilized with more examples.
- More features and interactions should be added to the UI for increased functionality.
