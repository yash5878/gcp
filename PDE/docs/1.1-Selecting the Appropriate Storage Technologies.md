## 1. Mapping Storage Systems to Business Requirements

### Introduction

Selecting the right storage technology starts with understanding your business requirements. This involves a deep understanding of what data needs to be stored, how it will be used, and what kind of performance and reliability is expected. Google Cloud offers a variety of storage solutions to cater to diverse business needs.

### Use Cases

- **Cold Data Storage**: When data is rarely accessed and needs to be stored cost-effectively, solutions like Google Cloud Storage (GCS) are suitable.
- **Real-time Analytics**: For applications requiring low-latency access to data for real-time analytics, Google Bigtable or Firestore can be considered.
- **Data Warehousing**: For large-scale data warehousing and analytical processing, BigQuery is a strong candidate.
- **IoT Data**: If your business deals with a vast amount of IoT data, Cloud IoT Core for data ingestion and Cloud Bigtable for storage can be ideal.
- **Backup and Archive**: Google Cloud Storage Nearline or Coldline can be used for backup and archival needs.

### Steps to Create or Use Storage Solutions

#### Google Cloud Storage

**Creating a GCS Bucket via CLI:**
```shell
# Create a new bucket
gsutil mb -c standard -l us-central1 gs://your-bucket-name
```

**Uploading a File to GCS Bucket via CLI:**
```shell
# Upload a file to the bucket
gsutil cp your-file.txt gs://your-bucket-name
```

#### Google Bigtable

```shell
# Open the HBase shell
cbt -instance your-instance-id

# Run HBase commands
create 'your-table', 'cf1'
put 'your-table', 'row1', 'cf1:col1', 'value1'
scan 'your-table'
```

#### Google BigQuery

**Running a Query in BigQuery via CLI:**

### Use Cases Combined

A typical data engineering scenario may involve a combination of these storage solutions to meet various business requirements. For example, a retail business might use Google Cloud Storage to store historical sales data for long-term archival (Cold Data Storage), Google Bigtable for real-time inventory management (Real-time Analytics), and BigQuery for complex sales trend analysis (Data Warehousing).

## 2. Data Modeling

### Introduction

Data modeling is a critical step in designing your storage solution. It involves structuring your data in a way that is efficient for storage and retrieval while aligning with your business needs. The choice of data modeling approach depends on the specific use case.

### Use Cases

- **Relational Data**: For structured, highly relational data, consider using a normalized data model in Google Cloud SQL or BigQuery.
- **Time-Series Data**: In cases involving time-series data, using a schema that supports time-based indexing and partitioning in Bigtable or BigQuery is beneficial.
- **Document-Oriented Data**: For semi-structured or document-oriented data, Cloud Firestore with a NoSQL data model might be suitable.
- **Graph Data**: If your data represents complex relationships, consider using a graph database like Neo4j on Compute Engine instances.

### Steps to Create or Use Data Models

#### Google Cloud SQL (Relational Data)

**Creating a Cloud SQL Instance via CLI:**
```shell
# Create a PostgreSQL instance
gcloud sql instances create your-instance-name --database-version=POSTGRES_13 --region=us-central1
```
