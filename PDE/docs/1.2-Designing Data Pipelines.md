## 1.2 Designing Data Pipelines

Designing data pipelines is a crucial step in the data engineering process, enabling the efficient collection, processing, and delivery of data to meet business requirements. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers a variety of tools and services to support data pipeline design, each with its unique considerations.

### 1.2.1 Data Publishing and Visualization (e.g., BigQuery)
