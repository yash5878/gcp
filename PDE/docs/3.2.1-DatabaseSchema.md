**Steps in Data Warehouse Design**

Here are the eight core steps that go into data warehouse design:

**1. Defining Business Requirements (or Requirements Gathering)**

Data warehouse design is a business-wide journey. Data warehouses touch all areas of your business, so every department needs to be on board with the design. Since your warehouse is only as powerful as the data it contains, aligning departmental needs and goals with the overall project is critical to your success.

So, if you currently can't combine all your sales data with all your marketing data, your overall query results are missing some critical components. Knowing which leads are valuable can help you get more value from your marketing data.

Every department needs to understand the purpose of the data warehouse, how it benefits them, and what kinds of results they can expect from your warehousing solution.

This Requirements Gathering stage should focus on the following objectives:

- Aligning departmental goals with the overall project
- Determining the scope of the project in relation to business processes
- Discovering your current and future needs by diving deep into your data (finding out what data is useful for analysis) and your current tech stack (where your data is currently siloed and not being used)
- Creating a disaster recovery plan in the case of system failure
- Thinking about each layer of security (e.g., threat detection, threat mitigation, identity controls, monitoring, risk reduction, etc.)
- Anticipating compliance needs and mitigating regulatory risks

You can think of this as your overall data warehouse blueprint. But this phase is more about determining your business needs, aligning those to your data warehouse, and, most importantly, getting everyone on board with the data warehousing solution.

**2. Setting Up Your Physical Environments**

Data warehouses typically have three primary physical environments — development, testing, and production. This mimics standard software development best practices, and your three environments exist on completely separate physical servers.

Why do you need three separate environments?

- You need a way to test changes before they move into the production environment.
- Some security best practices require that testers and developers never have access to production data.
- Running tests against data typically uses extreme data sets or random sets of data from the production environment — and you need a unique server to execute these tests _en masse_.
- Having a development environment is a necessity, and dev environments exist in a unique state of flux compared to production or test environments.
- Production environments have much higher workloads (_your whole business is using it_), so trying to run tests or develop in that environment can be stressful for both team members and servers.
- Data integrity is _much _easier to track, and issues are easier to contain when you have three environments running. It makes headhunting issues less stressful on your workloads, and data flow in production and testing environments can be stalled without impacting end users.
- Running tests can often introduce breakpoints and hang your entire server. That's not something you want happening in your production environment.
- Imagine sharing resources between production, testing, and development. You don't want that! Testing, development, and production environments all have different resource needs, and trying to combine all functions into one server can be catastrophic for performance.

Remember, [BI development](https://www.integrate.io/blog/top-business-intelligence-tools/) is an ongoing process that really never grinds to a halt. This is especially true in [Agile](https://www.integrate.io/glossary/what-is-agile-methodology/)/DevOps approaches to the software development lifecycle, which all require separate environments due to the sheer magnitude of constant changes and adaptations.

You can choose to run more than these three environments, and some business users choose to add additional environments for specific business needs. Integrate.io has seen staging environments that are separate from testing solely for quality assurance work, as well as demo and integration environments specifically for testing integrations.

You should have these three core environments, but you can layer in additional settings to fit your unique business goals.

**3. Data Warehouse Design: Introducing Data Modeling**

Data modeling is the process of visualizing data distribution in your warehouse. Think of it as a blueprint. Before you start building a house, it's important to know what goes where and _why it goes there_. That's what data modeling is to data warehouses.

Data modeling helps you:

- Visualize the relationships between data
- Set standardized naming conventions
- Create relationships between data sets
- Establish compliance and security processes
- Align your processes with your overarching IT goals

The above benefits of data modeling help improve decision-making throughout your organization.

However, data modeling is probably the most complex phase of data warehouse design, and there are multiple data modeling techniques businesses can choose from for warehouse design. Before jumping into a few of the most popular data modeling techniques, let's take a look at the differences between data warehouses and data marts:

A data warehouse is a system to store data in (or push data into) to run analytics and queries. A [data mart](https://www.integrate.io/blog/data-mart-vs-data-warehouse/), on the other hand, is an area within a data warehouse that stores data for a specific business function.

So, say you've built your entire data warehouse. That's great! But does it account for how different departments will use the data? Your sales team will use that data warehouse in a vastly different way than your legal team. Plus, certain workflows and data sets are only valuable to certain teams. Data marts are where all those team-specific data sets are stored, and related queries are processed.

Data modeling typically takes place at the data mart level and branches out into your data warehouse. It's the logic behind how you store certain data in relation to other data.

The three most popular data models for warehouses are:

1. Snowflake schema
2. Star schema
3. Galaxy schema

You should choose and develop a data model to guide your overall data architecture within your warehouse. The model you choose will impact the structure of your data warehouse and data marts — which impacts the ways that you utilize [ETL tools](https://www.integrate.io/blog/top-7-etl-tools/) like Integrate.io and run queries on that data.

**Overview of Star Schema vs Snowflake Schema **

When it comes to star schema and snowflake schema, it's essential to remember their basic definitions:

- **Star Schema** : A type of database schema where a single fact table references a number of dimension tables, forming a pattern that resembles a star. Star schemas offer an efficient way to organize information in a data warehouse
- **Snowflake Schema** : A more complex variation of the star schema, where dimension tables are normalized, leading to multiple related tables forming a pattern similar to a snowflake. [Snowflake](https://trial.snowflake.com/?owner=SPN-PID-28241&utm_source=Xplenty&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=SPIN) schemas are a variation of star schemas that allow for more efficient data processing.
- **Normalization** : A database design technique that reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity.

With these clarifications, let's delve deeper into the specifics of these schemas.

**Here is a comparison table of star and snowflake schemas: **

|
 | **Snowflake Schema** | **Star Schema** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Structure** | Consists of a centralized fact table connected to multiple-dimension tables in a hierarchical manner | Consists of a centralized fact table connected to dimension tables in a star-like structure |
| **Normalization** | Highly normalized design | Partially denormalized design |
| **Query**   **Performance** | Excellent for complex queries and aggregations | Better for simple queries and aggregations |
| **Storage Efficiency** | Highly efficient for storing data | Less efficient due to denormalization |
| **Scalability** | Highly scalable due to the separation of data | Limited scalability due to denormalization |
| **Data Integrity** | Ensures high data integrity | Lower data integrity due to denormalization |
| **Complexity** | More complex to design and maintain | Simpler to design and maintain |
| **Flexibility** | More flexible for changes in the data model | Less flexible for changes in the data model |
| **Usage** | Suitable for large, complex data warehouses | Suitable for small to medium-sized data warehouses |
| **Storage Overhead** | Requires less storage space | Requires more storage space |

Both schemas improve the speed and simplicity of read queries and complex data analysis—especially when dealing with large data sets that pull information from diverse sources.

Despite their similarities, star schemas and snowflake schemas have key differences that every data scientist and [data engineer](https://www.integrate.io/blog/data-engineering-what-does-a-data-engineer-do-how-do-i-become-one/) needs to understand. To answer the question of "What's the difference between star schema vs snowflake schema", we'll begin with an in-depth discussion of star schemas. Then, we'll move into snowflake schemas and explore a tutorial on what makes them unique.

**What Is a Star Schema?**

Star schemas offer the simplest structure for organizing data into a [data warehouse](https://www.integrate.io/blog/what-is-a-data-warehouse/). The center of a star schema consists of one or multiple "fact tables" that index a series of "dimension tables." To understand star schemas—and for that matter snowflake schemas—it's important to take an in-depth look at the two separate tables of fact tables and dimension tables.

The purpose of a star schema is to cull out numerical "fact" data relating to a business and separate it from the descriptive, or "dimensional" data. Fact data will include information like price, weight, speed, and quantities—i.e., data in a numerical format. Dimensional data will include uncountable things like colors, model names, geographical locations, employee names, salesperson names, etc., along with numerical information.

The fact data gets organized into fact tables and the dimensional data into dimension tables. Fact tables are the points of integration at the center of the star schema in the data warehouse. They allow machine learning tools to analyze the data as a single unit, and they allow other business systems to access the data together. Dimension tables hold and manage the data—numerical and non-numerical—which converges through fact tables that make up the data warehouse.

From a more technical perspective, fact tables keep track of numerical information related to different events. For example, they might include numeric values along with foreign keys that map to additional (descriptive and non-numerical) information in the dimension tables. Getting even more technical, fact tables maintain a low level of granularity (or "detail"), which is to say, they record information at a more atomic level. This could lead to the buildup of many records within the fact table over time.

**Types of Fact Tables**

There are three main kinds of fact tables:

- Transaction fact tables: These record information related to events, like individual merchandise sales.
- Snapshot fact tables: These record information that applies to specific moments in time, like year-end account statements.
- Accumulating snapshot tables: These record information related to a running tally of data, like year-to-date sales figures for specific merchandise or categories of merchandise.

**Types of Dimension Tables**

Dimension tables normally store fewer records than fact tables; however—in addition to storing numerical data—the records in dimension tables also include descriptive attributes. There are many types of dimension tables depending on the information system. Here are some examples:

- Time dimension tables: Information to identify the exact time, date, month, and year different events happened.
- Geography dimension tables: Address/location information.
- Employee dimension tables: Information about employees and salespeople, such as addresses, phone numbers, names, employee numbers, and email addresses.
- Merchandise dimension tables: Descriptive information about products, their product numbers, etc.
- Customer dimension tables: Customer name, numbers, contact information, addresses, etc.
- Range dimension tables: Information relating to a range of values for time, price, and other quantities.

**How Fact Tables and Dimension Tables Work Together**

Dimension tables usually list a surrogate primary key (i.e., a data type that consists of a single-column integer) that maps to attributes related to the natural key. Imagine you have a dimension table with information relating to different stores: "Dim\_Store" (see Star Schema illustration below). You can assign an ID number to each store and its row of related nonnumerical and other information—like store name, size, location, number of employees, category, etc. As it follows, wherever you list the Store ID number on the fact table ("Fact\_Sales"), it will map to that specific row of store data on the "Dim\_Store" dimension table.

Of course, the star schema doesn't stop there—because there are additional points (or dimension tables) with information that links to the fact table. As an example, let's say you want to know the following:

- How many products were purchased?
- What products were purchased?
- In what stores were the products purchased?
- What were the names and addresses of the products purchased?
- What brand name manufactured the products purchased?
- What day of the week did customers make each product purchased?

To conduct a query like this, you'll need to access data contained in all of the dimension tables (Dim\_Date, Dim\_Store, and Dim\_Product). These are separate databases; however, through the fact table—which serves as a point of integration—you can query all of the data, akin to it being in a single table. And that's how a star schema data warehouse works!

**Star Schema Diagram**

The following diagram illustrates what a simple star schema looks like:

![](RackMultipart20230926-1-mez4gi_html_6262f6e6b3869467.png)

\*Image: SqlPac at English Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0.

Here, the fact table, Fact\_Sales, is at the center of the diagram. Its schema includes the following columns for ID numbers: Date\_Id, Store\_Id, Product\_Id, and Units\_Sold. As the point of integration, the fact table integrates the diverse information in the dimension tables: Dim\_Product, Dim\_Store, and Dim\_Date.

As you can see, the star schema gets its name from having a central fact table "core," and dimension table "points." When a star schema has many dimension tables, data engineers might refer to it as a centipede schema.

**Denormalization of Data in Star Schemas**

The star schema's goal is to speed up read queries and analysis for massive amounts of data contained in diverse databases with different source schemas. The star schema achieves this goal through the "denormalization" of the data within the network of dimension tables.

Traditionally, database managers sought the "normalization" of data by eliminating duplicate copies of the same data, which is to say, the normalization of the duplicate information into one copy. This made writing commands faster because only one copy of the data needed updating.

When a data system expands into multiple dimension tables, however, accessing and analyzing data from multiple sources slows down read queries and analysis. To speed things up, the star schema relaxes the traditional rules of database normalization by "denormalizing" the data.

A star schema pulls the fact data (or ID number primary keys) from the dimension tables, duplicates this information, and stores it in the fact table. In that way, the fact table connects all of the information sources together. This makes read queries and analysis infinitely faster. However, it sacrifices the speed of writing commands. The slower write commands happen because the system needs to update all counterpart copies of the "denormalized" data following each update.

**Benefits of Star Schemas**

Star schemas offer the following benefits:

- **Queries are simpler** : Because all of the data connects through the fact table, the multiple dimension tables are treated as one large table of information, making queries simpler and easier to perform.
- **Easier business insights and reporting** : Star schemas simplify the process of pulling business reports like as-of-as and period-over-period reports.
- **Better-performing queries** : By removing the bottlenecks of a highly normalized schema, query speed increases, and the performance of read-only commands improves.
- **Provides data to OLAP systems** : OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems can use star schemas to build OLAP cubes.

**Challenges of Star Schemas**

As mentioned before, improving read queries and analysis in a star schema could involve certain challenges:

- **Decreased data integrity** : Because of the denormalized data structure, star schemas do not enforce data integrity very well. Although star schemas use countermeasures to prevent anomalies from developing, a simple insert or update command can still cause data incongruities.
- **Less capable of handling diverse and complex queries** : Database designers build and optimize star schemas for specific analytical needs. As denormalized data sets, they work best with a relatively narrow set of simple queries. Comparatively, a normalized schema permits a far wider variety of query complexity.
- **No many-to-many relationships** : Because they offer a single-dimension schema, star schemas don't work well for "[many-to-many data relationships](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27291/many-to-many-relationship?utm_source=xp&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=content)."

**What Is a Snowflake Schema?**

Now that you understand how star schemas work, you're ready to explore the [snowflake](https://trial.snowflake.com/?owner=SPN-PID-28241&utm_source=Xplenty&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=SPIN) schema— which takes the shape of a snowflake. The purpose of a snowflake schema is to normalize the denormalized data in a star schema. This solves the write command slow-downs and other problems typically associated with "star schemas."

The snowflake schema is a "multi-dimensional" structure. At its core are fact tables that connect the information found in the dimension tables, which radiate outward like in the star schema. The difference is that the dimension tables in the snowflake schema divide themselves into more than one table. That creates the snowflake pattern.

Through this "snowflaking" method, the snowflake schema normalizes the dimension tables it connects with by (1) getting rid of "[low cardinality](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/18/cardinality-databases?utm_source=xp&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=content)" attributes (that appear multiple times in the parent table); and (2) turning the dimension tables into more than one table, until the dimension tables are completely normalized.

Like snowflake patterns in nature, the snowflake database becomes exceedingly complex. The schema can produce elaborate data relationships, where child tables have more than one parent table.

[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/9.7?topic=schemas-star-snowflake) offers an excellent comparison of snowflake schemas versus star schemas, stating: "Star and snowflake schema designs are mechanisms to separate facts and dimensions into separate tables ... A snowflake schema can have any number of dimensions and each dimension can have any number of levels."

**Snowflake Schema Diagram**

Before we go too deep into the snowflaking concept, it's time to look at an illustration of a snowflake schema:

![](RackMultipart20230926-1-mez4gi_html_43151561e9d9d010.png)

**\*Image: SqlPac at English Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0.**

Do you see how the above illustration took the star table example, and "snowflaked" each dimensional table outward? Let's examine the Dim\_Product dimension table. What has happened is that various columns of the Dim\_Product table have snowflaked outward into lookup tables.

In the star schema example, Dim\_Product included the nonnumerical names of the brands. Now it just includes the Brand\_Id number which points to the Dim\_Brand lookup table. By translating the Dim\_Product table into a numerical value like this, we increase the speed at which the system can process queries. More importantly, we reduce the amount of space required to store data. That's because the Dim\_Product table no longer includes multiple entries of the full names of brands (which are long strings of data compared to the Brand\_Id numbers).

Long story short, a number requires a dramatically reduced amount of space and time for processing than a written name or qualitative descriptive value. Therefore, snowflaking the dimension tables out into lookup tables can save a lot on storage costs when dealing with millions of rows and columns of data.

If you're dealing with mountains of data, you're probably also trying to solve the age-old problem of how to move that data around and gain visibility into it. After you [start your 14-day free trial ](https://www.integrate.io/demo/)of Integrate.io, [schedule a meeting with our team](https://www.integrate.io/demo/) to learn how our powerful ETL tools can help you effortlessly push and pull data throughout your systems.

**Benefits of Snowflake Schemas**

Snowflake schemas offer the following benefits compared to normal star schemas:

- **Compatible with many OLAP database modeling tools** : Certain OLAP database tools, which data scientists use for data analysis and modeling, are specifically designed to work snowflake data schemas.
- **Saves on data storage requirements** : Normalizing the data that would typically get denormalized in a star schema can offer a tremendous reduction in disk space requirements. Essentially, this is because you're converting long strings of non-numerical data (the information pertaining to descriptors and names) into numerical keys that are dramatically less taxing from a storage perspective.

**Challenges of Snowflake Schemas**

There are three potential challenges relating to snowflake schemas:

- **Complex data schemas** : As you might imagine, snowflake schemas create many levels of complexity while normalizing the attributes of a star schema. This complexity results in more complicated source query joins. In offering a more efficient way to store data, Snowflake can result in performance declines while browsing these complex joins. Still, processing technology advancements have resulted in improved snowflake schema query performance in recent years, which is one of the reasons why snowflake schemas are rising in popularity.
- **Slower at processing cube data** : In a snowflake schema, the complex joins result in slower cube data processing. The star schema is generally better for cube data processing.
- **Lower data integrity levels** : While snowflake schemas offer greater normalization and fewer risks of data corruption after performing UPDATE and INSERT commands, they do not provide the level of transnational assurance that comes with a traditional, highly normalized database structure. Therefore, when loading data into a snowflake schema, it's vital to be careful and double-check the quality of information post-loading.

**4. Choosing Your Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Solution**

[ETL or Extract, Transform, Load](https://www.integrate.io/blog/what-is-etl/) is the process used to pull data out of your current tech stack or existing storage solutions and put it into your warehouse. It goes something like this:

- You  **extract**  data from a source system and place it into a staging area.
- You  **transform**  that data into the best format for data analytics. You also remove any duplicated data or inconsistencies that can make analysis difficult.
- You then  **load**  the data to a data warehouse before pushing it through BI tools like Tableau and Looker.

Normally, [ETL](https://www.informatica.com/resources/articles/what-is-etl.html) is a complicated process that requires manual pipeline-building and lots of code. Building these pipelines can take weeks or even months and might require a data engineering team. That's where ETL solutions come in. They automate many tasks associated with this data management and integration process, freeing up resources for your team.

You should pay careful attention to the ETL solution you use so you can improve business decisions. Since ETL is responsible for the bulk of the in-between work, choosing a subpar tool or developing a poor [ETL process](https://www.integrate.io/blog/etl-data-warehousing-explained-etl-tool-basics/) can break your entire warehouse. You want optimal speeds, high availability, good visualization, and the ability to build easy, replicable, and consistent data pipelines between all your existing architecture and your new warehouse.

This is where ETL tools like Integrate.io are valuable. Integrate.io creates hyper-visualized data pipelines between all your valuable tech architecture while cleaning and nominalizing that data for compliance and ease of use.

Remember, a good ETL process can mean the difference between a slow, painful-to-use data warehouse and a simple, functional warehouse that's valuable throughout every layer of your organization.

ETL will likely be the go-to for pulling data from systems into your warehouse. Its counterpart [Extract, Load, Transfer](https://dashboard.integrate.io/auth/signup?tool=CDC&_gl=1) (ELT) negatively impacts the performance of most custom-built warehouses since data is loaded directly into the warehouse before data organization and cleansing occur. However, there might be other data integration use cases that suit the ELT process. Integrate.io not only executes ETL but can handle ELT, Reverse ETL, and Change Data Capture (CDC), as well as provide data observability and data warehouse insights.

**5. Online Analytic Processing (OLAP) Cube**

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cubes are commonly used in the data warehousing process to enable faster, more efficient analysis of large amounts of data. OLAP cubes are based on multidimensional databases that store summarized data and allow users to quickly analyze information from different dimensions.

Here's how an OLAP cube fits into the data warehouse design:

- OLAP cubes are designed to store pre-aggregated data that has been processed from various sources in a data warehouse. The data is organized into a multi-dimensional structure that enables users to view and analyze it from different perspectives.
- OLAP cubes are created using a process called cube processing, which involves aggregating and storing data in a way that enables fast retrieval and analysis. Cube processing can be performed on a regular basis to ensure that the data is up-to-date and accurate.
- OLAP cubes enable users to perform complex analytical queries on large volumes of data in real-time, making it easier to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies. Users can also slice and dice data in different ways to gain deeper insights into their business operations.
- OLAP cubes support drill-down and roll-up operations, which allow users to navigate through different levels of data granularity. Users can drill down to the lowest level of detail to view individual transactions or roll up to higher levels of aggregation to view summary data.
- OLAP cubes can be accessed using a variety of tools, including spreadsheets, reporting tools, and business intelligence platforms. Users can create reports and dashboards that display the data in a way that is meaningful to them.

You'll likely need to address OLAP cubes if you're designing your entire database from scratch, or if you're maintaining your own OLAP cube — which typically requires specialized personnel.

So, if you plan to use a vendor warehouse solution (e.g., [Redshift or BigQuery](https://www.integrate.io/blog/redshift-vs-bigquery-comprehensive-guide/)) you probably won't need an OLAP cube (cubes are rarely used in either of those solutions\*.)

\*_ **Note:** __ some vendor solutions will let you build OLAP cubes on top of Redshift or BigQuery data marts, but Integrate.io can't recommend any since it has never used them personally._

If you have a set of BI tools requiring an OLAP cube for ad-hoc reporting, you may need to develop one or use a vendor solution.

**OLAP Cubes vs. Data Warehouse**

Here are the differences between a data warehouse and OLAP cubes:

- A data warehouse is where you store your business data in an easily analyzable format to be used for a variety of business needs.
- Online Analytic Processing cubes help you analyze the data in your data warehouse or data mart. Most of the time, OLAP cubes are used for reporting, but they have plenty of other use cases.

Since your data warehouse will have data coming in from multiple data pipelines, OLAP cubes help you organize all that data in a multi-dimensional format that makes analyzing it rapid and straightforward. OLAP cubes are a critical component of data warehouse design because they provide fast and efficient access to large volumes of data, enabling users to make informed business decisions based on insights derived from the data.

You may require custom-built OLAP cubes, or you may need to hire support to help you maintain your cubes.

These resources on OLAP cubes can help you dig deeper:

**6. Data Warehouse Design: Creating the Front End**

So far, this guide has only covered back-end processes. There needs to be front-end visualization, so users can immediately understand and apply the results of data queries.

That's the job of your front end. There are plenty of tools on the market that help with visualization. BI tools like Tableau (or PowerBI for those using BigQuery) are great for visualization. You can also develop a custom solution — though that's a significant undertaking.

Most small-to-medium-sized businesses lean on established BI kits like those mentioned above. But, some businesses may need to develop their own BI tools to meet ad-hoc analytic needs. For example, a Sales Ops manager at a large company may need a specific BI tool for territory strategies. This tool would probably be custom-developed given the scope of the company's sales objectives.

You should pay keen attention to reporting during this stage. How often does reporting need to be done? Do you need each person to create their own reports? Questions like these should guide you to a BI toolkit that fits your unique requirements.

**Pro-tip** : Keep it simple. Your employees don't care about most of the fancy features or deep complexities. They just want something that works for them and makes their lives easier.

**7. Optimizing Queries**

Optimizing queries is a critical part of data warehouse design. One of the primary goals of building a data warehouse is to provide fast and efficient access to data for decision-making. During the design process, data architects need to consider the types of queries that users will be running and design the data warehouse schema and indexing accordingly.

Optimizing your queries is a complex process that's hyper-unique to your specific needs. But there are some general rules of thumb.

We  **heavily recommend**  the following during database design:

- **Ensure your production, testing, and development environments have mirrored resources.**  This mirroring prevents the server from hanging when you push projects from one environment to the next.
- **Try to minimize data retrieval. ** Don't run SELECT on the whole database if you only need a column of results. Instead, run your SELECT query by targeting specific columns. This is especially important if you're paying for your query power separately.
- **Understand the limitations of your OLAP vendor. ** BigQuery uses a hybrid SQL language, and RedShift is built on top of a Postgre fork. Knowing the little nuances baked into your vendor can help you maximize workflows and speed up queries.

**8. Establishing a Rollout Plan**

Once you're ready to launch your warehouse, it's time to start thinking about education, training, and use cases. Most of the time, it will be a week or two before your end-users start seeing any functionality from that warehouse (at least at scale). But they should be adequately trained in its use before the rollout is completed.

A rollout plan typically includes the following steps:

1. **Identifying the target audience: ** This involves determining which groups or individuals within the organization will benefit from using the data warehouse.
2. **Determining the data requirements** : This involves identifying the types of data that the target audience needs access to and ensuring that this data is available within the data warehouse.
3. **Developing user-friendly interfaces:**  This involves creating user interfaces that are intuitive and easy to use, and that provide users with the ability to interact with the data in meaningful ways.
4. **Testing and refining:**  This involves conducting user testing to ensure that the data warehouse meets the needs of its users, and making adjustments as necessary.
5. **Training users:**  This involves providing training and support to users to help them understand how to use the data warehouse effectively.
6. **Deploying the data warehouse: ** This involves introducing the data warehouse to its intended users, and ensuring that the rollout process goes smoothly.

By establishing a rollout plan, organizations can ensure that their data warehouse is introduced effectively and that users are able to make the most of the valuable data that it contains.
