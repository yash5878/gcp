## Example: Launching a Python Application to Calculate Pi using Dataproc

Here's an example of launching a Python application to calculate the value of Pi using Google Cloud Dataproc:

1. **Create a Python Script**:

   Create a Python script that calculates Pi using a suitable algorithm. Save this script, e.g., `calculate_pi.py`.

   ```python
   import random

   def calculate_pi(num_samples):
       inside_circle = 0
       for _ in range(num_samples):
           x = random.random()
           y = random.random()
           if x**2 + y**2 <= 1:
               inside_circle += 1
       return (inside_circle / num_samples) * 4

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       num_samples = 1000000
       result = calculate_pi(num_samples)
       print(f"Estimated value of Pi: {result}")
   ```

2. **Upload the Script**:

   Upload the Python script to a location accessible by Dataproc, such as Google Cloud Storage or HDFS.

3. **Submit a Dataproc Job**:

   Use the `gcloud` command to submit a Dataproc job to run the Python script on the cluster.

   ```bash
   gcloud dataproc jobs submit pyspark \
     --cluster=CLUSTER_NAME \
     --region=REGION \
     --py-files=SCRIPT_LOCATION/calculate_pi.py \
     SCRIPT_LOCATION/calculate_pi.py
   ```

   Replace `CLUSTER_NAME`, `REGION`, and `SCRIPT_LOCATION` with your specific values.

4. **Monitor Job Progress**:

   You can monitor the job's progress and view the output using the Dataproc web interfaces or `gcloud` CLI.

This example demonstrates how to leverage Dataproc to perform distributed data processing tasks using Python and Spark. The script estimates the value of Pi using a Monte Carlo method.
